I will present the results of a longitudinal study demonstrating that implementation of this calculus-enhanced “energy-first” curriculum improved performance in downstream engineering courses for students with lower ACT math scores.

The course followed the Project-Based-Learning (PjBL) approach in which students, by way of argumentation and research, actively and collaboratively engaged in solving real-world and personally meaningful problems. As such, Information Literacy skills were naturally incorporated throughout all of the PjBL projects that students worked on in this course. In preparation for these projects, students learned about basic principles behind ultrasound, as well as the basic operation, controls, and features of an ultrasound equipment. They were also trained to develop ultrasound skills to identify normal anatomy of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and abdominal organs and structures. We will present about the opportunities, challenges, and success of this course."

The supplemental instructor is a junior or senior level student with a track record of a sound knowledge of the material and works closely with the students seeking help. The SI leader is free to provide different teaching/learning strategies to foster problem-solving skills and critical thinking behavior. While the supplemental instructor is independent in conducting the learning sessions, they work closely with the course instructor. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of the SI model in the university physics at Southern Arkansas University using data from ten years. Furthermore, we discuss how this additional teaching pedagogy elucidates to successful completion of the physics class, retention in the department/university, and the overall academic success through the peers’ support.

However, it has been shown in past research that high school students are not learning, or perhaps not understanding, how to read graphs— specifically kinematic graphs of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. My MQP project was based on this notion, and was an investigation into ways to help students become more proficient in graphicacy. I had the opportunity to teach physics at Leominster High School (LHS). The approach for the project was to teach the regular curriculum with a greater focus on graphing and graphing methods for solving physics problems. The results were measured with a pre and post test which assessed students’ confidence in graphing, their ability to graph kinematics scenarios, and their ability to draw conclusions from more complex graphs. Results of the posttest were better than the pretest in all categories. These results are promising and demonstrate that if teachers have a more focused instruction on graphicacy supplementary to their normal curriculum, student understanding of graphicacy
itself may increase. "

Physics lab courses are an ideal setting to learn these communication skills. Writing is an important subset of communicating physics, which has been explored in the “Framework of Goals for Writing in Physics Lab Classes” from Hoehn and Lewandowski. The overall goal of this project is to use this framework to understand how students acquire writing skills in physics, to structure labs to support learning those skills, and to measure the effectiveness of scaffolding writing skills into the lab sequence. At our institution, we are restructuring the lab sequence to scaffold writing skills. We collected and analyzed student writing samples and open response feedback surveys and will present preliminary results."

Human vision is a perplexing cycle which not only enable to ‘see’ the objects but seeing often associated with another complex phenomena called perception that is not yet understood totally. Computer vision is an innovative execution of human vision that empowers computer to accomplish certain human vision capacities, but it is surpassing the human vision in some areas for example in contrast sensitivity and visual acuity which are key important aspect of object recognition and segmentation from a scene. In ophthalmology artificial intelligence (AI) has been primarily applied to medical image analysis, in which AI have shown robust diagnostic performance in detecting various eye diseases early. AI for an eye, particularly in ocular imaging used fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images as an input and provide the output whether the individual has disease or not at early state which is very important for therapeutic intervention of retinal disease such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration. Using AI, here, we have shown measurement of retinal nerve and ganglion cell layer as hallmark of retinal diseases with higher accuracy and precision than conventional image processing method."

The applications of present neutron detector system are limited by the cost, size, weight, power requirements, and performance of the system. The self-powered or very low power consuming solid state neutron detector using highly matured silicon technology would provide significant benefits in terms of cost and volume, as well as allow for wafer level integration with charge preamplifier and readout electronics. We present here current research advances at RPI on the fabrication and characterization of large area solid state thermal neutron detector module with detection area up to 16 cm2. The detector utilizes three dimensional honeycomb silicon micro-structures with continuous p+-n junction diode filled with en-riched boron (99% of 10B) as a converter material for thermal neutron detection. A continuous p-n junction formed over the entire surface of the microstructure helps to achieve an extremely low leakage current density of ~6.1×10-9 A/cm2 at -1 V for a 2.5×2.5 mm2 detector. This extremely low leakage current results in low electronic noise, which enables the fabrication of large-area detectors. An intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency of ~26% for a 2.5×2.5 mm2 detector element was obtained under zero bias voltage from Maxwellian spectra incident normally on the detector surfaces. Further, we measured the efficiency of these detectors, using a single pre-amp, as a function of detection area and found that thermal neutron detection efficiency remains almost same up to 8cm2 and decreases by 20% when the device area increases from 8 to 16 cm2. These current results show the promise of achieving highly efficient large area solid state thermal neutron detectors with low gamma sensitivity at low cost using matured silicon processing technology for future applications."

The surfaces of a three-dimensional TI consist of a massless Dirac cone, which is characterized by the Z2 topological invariant. Introduction of magnetism on the surface of a TI is essential to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect and other novel magneto-electric phenomena. Here, by using a combination of first-principles calculations, magneto-transport and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we study the electronic properties of gadolinium (Gd)-doped Sb2Te3. Our study shows that Gd doped Sb2Te3 is a spin-orbit-induced bulk band-gap material, whose surface is characterized by a single topological surface state. Our results provide a new platform to investigate the interactions between dilute magnetism and topology in magnetic doped topological materials."

Despite being the most studied nodal-line semimetal, a clear understanding of the transient state relaxation dynamics and the underlying mechanism in ZrSiS is lacking. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we study the ultrafast relaxation dynamics in ZrSiS and reveal a unique relaxation in the bulk nodalline state which is well-captured by a simple model based on optical and acoustic phonon cooling. Our model predicts linear decay processes for both optical and acoustic phonon relaxations with optical cooling dominant at higher temperatures.

Since the water is indispensable component in materials and life sciences, the detailed study of muon and Mu in ice and water is necessary to understand/apply the muon technique to wide variety of sciences like life sciences, medical/clinical fields, etc. In order to apply the muon method for detection of oxygen in hypoxia in tumor, electron transfer in protein, function of DNA, photosynthesis, etc., we have started the systematic experimental and theoretical study in water and constituents of protein towards whole targeted system. In the program, brief review and recent achievements (experimental results and theoretical interpretation using DFT calculations and Quantum simulation) in muSR studies in water and ice will be presented.

Semiconductor spintronics devices that rely on manipulating electronic spin for spin-based information processing and storage applications have seen significant progress over the past several decades. However, the advent of optically active 2D materials has enabled optically addressable electronic valley pseudospin degrees of freedom which have led to the concept of valleytronic devices with a wide range of applications in transport phenomenon, electrical, magnetic, and spin control. Specifically, valley manipulation has been demonstrated via a strong external magnetic field which is an essential component for creating valley-based logic gates. The recent rise of 2D vdW ferromagnets not only unlocks new methods to control such spin-valley degrees of freedom at room temperature but enables magnetic sensing via van der Waals heterostructure engineering. For example, the proximity effect can be harnessed for all-optical readout of the magnetic properties such as magnetic hysteresis, local magnetic field, domain dynamics, and the interlayer magnetic dipole, as the electronic valley transition follows the optical selection rule. Such heterostructure assembly also makes on-chip manipulation of spins and g-factor possible without the need for huge superconducting coils to generate an external magnetic field. In our work, we have assembled heterostructure of Fe3GeTe2(FGT) and mono/bi-layer MoS2 (TMDC) and study the valley Zeeman splitting and valley polarization via photoluminescence spectroscopy of MoS2/FGT heterostructure as a function of temperature. Such assembly will lead to all-optical room temperature sensing of van der Waals magnet via 2D valley degree of freedom and spin-valley polarization of 2D excitons via magnetic proximity effect of a van der Waals magnet."

Canadine, an active component of Goldenseal, gives 132 modes of vibration. The electronic absorption in EtOH solvent phase was recorded at 294 and 386nm. Oncocalyxone A, an antiplatelet and known for the treatment of cuts and wounds, gives 114 modes of vibration. The electronic absorption in the methanol environment was recorded at 495 and 280nm.

The orthorhombic distortion stabilizes the Jeff = ½ pseudospin moment direction along the longer lattice direction via magnetic anisotropy while it lead to non-zero interlayer exchange interaction energy. Resonant X-ray magnetic scattering confirms that the magnetic moment is parallel to the elongated b-axis whereas its stacking pattern is inverted from that of the tetragonal Sr2IrO4 crystal. This combination corresponds to the La2CuO4-type interlayer antiferromagnetic order which can be explained by the competition between interlayer interaction energies such that the net asymmetric interlayer exchange interaction energy between a and b-axes exceed the interlayer pseudo-dipolar interaction energy. Our result suggests that anisotropic strain-induced orthorhombic distortion provides a delicate knob for tuning the long-range magnetic order and enhancing the magnetic quantum fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional systems.

Considering the significance of natural gas, such as methane, and the difficulties in storing it, research is increasingly focusing on developing materials for solid-state methane storage. Two-dimensional materials have a large number of possible adsorption sites for gas molecules due to their high surface-to-volume ratio.  However, the two-dimensional structure is chemically inactive and attracts nonpolar gases rather weakly [1]. We investigated the methane gas adsorption capabilities of silicene by activating it with different defects [2,3]. According to our density functional theory calculations, the mono-vacancy (MV) defect is advantageous in increasing the binding strength of energy-carrying gases such as methane. In MV defected silicene, methane adsorption energy is detected in the order of the internationally specified energy regime [4].

Electronic and magnetic properties of quaternary Heusler alloy ZrRuTiIn have been analyzed by using
density functional theory (DFT) based Wien2k approach. The optimized structure of ZrRuTiIn is
obtained through the energy minimization process. The ferromagnetic ground state and
thermodynamical stability of compound is supported by relative total energy and by derived cohesive
energy respectively. From the study, the quaternary Heusler alloy ZrRuTiIn shows half-metallic
ferromagnetic and spin-polarized density of states (DOS). The spin dependent band gap, that is, Half-
metallic gap of ZrRuTiIn is 0.61 eV. We have obtained unsymmetrical nature of DOS in up and down
spin channels. The total spin magnetic moment of ZrRuTiIn is 1.00 ? B , which is integral value
supporting HMF nature of ZrRuTiIn. Detailed study of strain effects of quaternary Heusler alloy
ZrRuTiIn will be comprehensibly presented.

System planets, that these exoplanets are capable of hosting one or multiple exomoons. In
this paper, we study the possible existence of hypothetical Earth-mass and Luna-mass moons
orbiting the Jupiter-mass planet, Laligurans (HD 100777b) in the Sagarmatha (HD 100777)
star system by means of orbital stability. We apply long-term orbital integrations and MEGNO
(Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits) chaos indicator to study the orbital stability of the
moons and predict a phase-space region comprising of periodic, chaotic, and unstable orbits.
The phase-spaces primarily constitute the moon’s semimajor axis which extends from host
planet’s Roche radius to the Hill radius, and full range of eccentricity. Specific points are picked
from three different regions of MEGNO map and run as single-orbit integration for up to 10
billion period of innermost orbit. Furthermore, the lifetime and maximum eccentricity maps are generated from the direct integration to inspect the stable and unstable orbital configurations.
The analyses of these maps, with the aid of time series plots, show that both moons maintain
stable orbits in the low eccentricity regime and semimajor axis between the Roche limit and
28.4% of Hill radius of the planet."

We study a sample of compact star-forming dwarf galaxies that are selected from a merging dwarf galaxy catalog. We present a detailed study of their morphological and structural properties. We find that these BCDs-looking galaxies host extended stellar shells and thus are confirmed to be a dwarf-dwarf merger. Their stellar masses range between 8×10^7 M_? and 2×10^9 M_?. Although the extended tail and shell are prominent in the deep optical images, the overall major axis light profile is well modeled with a two-component Sersic function of inner compact and extended outer radii. We calculate the inner and outer component stellar-mass ratio using the two-component modeling. We find an average of merger ratio 1:10 for our sample, indicating these galaxies might have suffered a satellite accretion, which triggers the starburst in the center of the host galaxies. From the measurement of H? equivalent width, we derived the star-formation ages of these galaxies. The derived star-formation ages of these galaxies turn out to be less than 100 M_? yr-1, suggesting the recent ignition of star-formation due to events of satellite interaction.

In the left phase of Post-Main Sequence evolution, these dust are found to be surrounding the White Dwarfs (WD). Some small fraction of dust is also formed in the circumstellar shells and cavities around WD which is usually a source of infrared (IR) excess. Formation and evolution of such IR dust structures are the results of high pressure events and such structures are crucial in the study of interaction phenomena in ISM.
 This research project is focused on the study of an isolated dust structure near the white dwarf WD0011-399 located at R.A. (J2000)

(J2000) -39$^{\circ}$ 37$^{'}$ 24.28$^{''}$ using Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS (IRIS), AKARI and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) surveys from SkyView Virtual Observatory along with SIMBAD Astronomical Database and Gaia Archive of ESA. The size of the cavity under study is 5.42 pc$\times$2.75 pc, 1.87pc$\times$0.87pc and 1.03$\times$0.51pc with inclination angle of 62.32$^{\circ}$, 65.57$^{\circ}$ and 62.27$^{\circ}$ respectively in IRIS, AKARI and WISE data suggesting that the cavity is neither a face-on nor an edge-on. The relative flux density  of the region has been studied through pixel extraction of FIR images (0.5$^{\circ}$, 30 pixels) and dust color temperature along with dust mass has been calculated. 
Using IRIS data the temperature of the whole region is found between a maximum value 36.82$\pm$4.30 K to a minimum 22.59$\pm$2.32 K with an offset 14.23 K. The average temperature of the region is 28.22$\pm$0.18 K. Following similar procedures for AKARI data, the temperature is found between a maximum of 26.37$\pm$3.56 K and a minimum of 16.32$\pm$1.47 K with an offset of 10.06K. The average temperature is 19.25$\pm$0.15 K. Similarly, using WISE data, the temperature is found between a maximum of 353.72$\pm$18.54 K and a minimum of 307.24$\pm$4.69 K with an offset of 46.48K. The average temperature is 316.62$\pm$0.81 K. High value of offset temperature suggests that the cavity might be evolving with disruptions from background radiative sources. Approximately Gaussian distribution of the temperature in all the surveys implies that the region might be tending towards local thermodynamic equilibrium. The total mass of the structure is estimated to be around 0.03M$_\odot$, 1.6$\times$10$^{-3}$M$_\odot$ and 10$^{-7}$M$_\odot$ using IRIS, AKARI and WISE data respectively. The Jean's mass of the structure was calculated assuming the structure as non-degenerate gas, which was estimated around 2001.93M$_\odot$, 178.44M$_\odot$ and 121.47M$_\odot$ using IRIS, AKARI and WISE data. Since Jean's mass is much greater than the mass of the structure there seems no possibility of star formation within the region of interest.
The color maps show identical distribution for all wavelengths however, no significant relation was observed between dust color temperature and dust mass."

The bipolar dust structure, hardly resolved in IRIS (60 ?m and 100 ?m), is clearly resolved in AKARI (90 ?m and 140 ?m) and WISE (12 ?m and 22 ?m) image. The dust color temperature and dust mass are calculated from infrared flux density in each bipolar dust structures in all surveys. In IRIS data the average value of dust color temperature in isolated dust structure is 27.57 K. The bipolar isolated upper and lower dust cloud have average temperature; 22.64 K and 22.63 K in AKARI data and 295.34 K and 296.85 K in WISE data respectively. The wide range of temperature suggests the bipolar dust structure is dynamically active. The mass of dust are found to be 6.53×1024 kg in IRIS data, 1.66×1026 kg and 5.60×1026 kg in two bipolar region in AKARI data and 5.48×1025kg and 6.32×1025kg in WISE data. A good correlation is found between the infrared fluxes in all survey with r2value 0.83 in IRIS and more than 0.90 in AKARI and WISE data. SIMBAD database explored few sources including Supernova Remnants nearby the bipolar dust, which might be the progenitor of dust as well as the contributor of energetic radiation. The Gaussian modeling of temperature is found to be distributed Normally. The contour plot of dust color temperature and dust mass shows non-uniform variation among IRIS, AKARI and WISE survey. We have tried to establish the relation between temperature and mass using linear regression.

A major contributor to this warming is the absorption of sunlight by aerosol particles, especially black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC), which are emitted from combustion sources, and natural dust particles, which dominantly contribute to the aerosol mass loading over many continental regions, including parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau. However, quantitative determination and attribution of the atmospheric warming produced by these aerosol types has been difficult, especially due to a 50% uncertainty in their contribution to absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD). Developing effective mitigation options for climate change over South Asia, a major aerosol hot spot, yet vulnerable and relatively poorly-studied region, requires a better quantification of the contributions of absorbing aerosol particles. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty in climate change. Over Asia, a global aerosol hotspot, spatial patterns of aerosol emissions are changing mainly because of changes in anthropogenic emissions, producing a dipole in atmospheric aerosol loading between East (decrease in emissions) and South Asia (increase in emissions). The resultant aerosol radiative effects are expected to be different as compared to the last decades of the 20th century because of this emerging Asian aerosol dipole. The projection and assessments of radiative and climate impacts of aerosols rely on simulating accurately the aerosol properties, thus, making it imperative that current climate models involved in climate assessments including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report, simulate well the magnitude and trends in changing aerosol properties. Results obtained for the first time on light-absorbing aerosols using new and high-quality observations, and on the trends in aerosols over Asia and their climate impact from satellites, ground-based observations and simulations from climate models with state-of-the-art treatment of aerosol chemistry, physics and meteorology will be presented."

Data are extracted from AERONET websites between 2010 to 2019 with the standard deviation at these three sites. We are mainly focused to understand variations in aerosol optical properties: aerosol optical depth (AOD), angstrom parameter (? and ?), visibility, single-scattering albedo (SSA), refractive index (real and imaginary) radioactive forcing, and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) respectively. The maximum and minimum values of AOD (440nm) in Beijing occurred mostly in summer and winter respectively, whereas the ranges of AOD over Kanpur and Pokhara were found to be lower. AOD, angstrom exponent (? and ?), visibility, single-scattering albedo, refractive index, radioactive forcing, and absorption aerosol optical depth of the aerosols are unique and different from regular seasonal fluctuations. The turbidity coefficient(?) was inversely related to visibility. The Visibility over Pokhara was found to be three times more than Kanpur and Beijing. The SSA and AAOD are found to be wavelength-dependent over these three stations.

become a major threat for exoatmospheric objects orbiting in space such as satellites. We have 
implemented high laser fluxes and fluences as a surrogate for x-ray irradiation to generate 
thermomechanical shocks at multi-Mbar levels and have studied the underlying physics of laser–matter interactions. The effect of laser pulse lengths on energy coupling into silicon has beeninvestigated in experiments on the OMEGA EP Laser System at the University of Rochester’sLaboratory for Laser Energetics. We used three-layer planar targets consisting of 50-um silicon,25-um copper, and 500-um quartz layers where the Si layer was irradiated at a fixed intensity of 10^15 W/cm^22 with varying pulse lengths of 100-ps, 500-ps, 1-ns, and 10-ns duration. Analytical and theoretical predictions show that the ablation pressure of laser-produced plasma and hot-plasma blowoff scales with laser intensity and pulse length. Analytical predictions of ablation pressures, ignoring pulse-length scaling, are in good agreement with the measurements for pulse length tau= 10 ns, but in disagreement for tau<=1 ns. Coronal plasma densities and ablation temperatures have been inferred as a function of the pulse lengths via 4w angular filtered refractometry and x-ray spectroscopy, respectively. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulations are used to generate simulated plasma density and plasma temperature profiles. Comparisons of measurements with the radiation hydrodynamic simulations and analytical solutions reveal that there exists a critical time necessary for the ablation pressure to accumulate near the target surface and that shock decay and multiple wave effects strongly dictate the evolving shock profile that propagates within the laser-shocked target as ultimately measured by rear-surface diagnostics [1] These results clearly demonstrate that 
the laser pulse length plays a pivotal role in plasma ablation and strong shock generation for laser impulse studies.

The seeds become more hydrophilic and they can absorb more water such that their germination is faster. Plasma activated water is produced by exposing the gliding arc plasma in water, which is then used for irrigation for various agricultural products. The plasma activated water has decreased the ph of water and increased the conductivity.

At the magic wavelength the transition frequency is independent of the intensity of the trapping laser field. Experimentally feasible magic wavelengths of transitions with small slopes in the atomic polarizabilities are determined; these are the most stable magic wavelengths against variations of the laser frequency.

The dust charging coefficient is plasma species dependent and its nature varies greatly when the hot electron density is considerably large. The damping rate due to dust charge fluctuation including the instability of IAWs explicitly depends upon the magnitude of dusty plasma parameters.

sheath in the presence of electron impact ionization source and sink terms using fluid model.
The set of governing fluid equations have been solved for given initial conditions, whereas
the dust charging equations have been solved using Newton-Raphson method to find the dust
charge at every position in the sheath region. The magnitude of potential monotonically
increases towards the wall and in terms of magnitude, the potential drop in the sheath region
increases from 246 to 332 as the non-thermal electron distribution approaches to Boltzmann
distribution. The particle densities decrease towards the wall; however, the decreasing rate of
electrons is much faster than that of ions and dust particles. The peak value appears on the
space charge density profile in between 6.0 to 13.0 electron Debye lengths from the sheath
entrance and it decreases towards the wall after that peak value. The non-thermal electron
distribution affects the flow of velocity of ions and dust particles in the sheath region. The
dust is negatively charged close to the sheath entrance due to higher attachment rate of
electrons and this decrease as the non-thermal electron distribution approaches to Boltzmann
distribution. As the dust particles flow towards the wall, the attachment rate of ions increases
and this dominates over the electrons attachment rate close to the wall. The obtained results
are useful to understand the plasma-wall interaction mechanism which is crucial in various
applications such as in sputtering, etching, electronic industry, fusion devices, plasma
processing, and many more.

Here we demonstrate a simple approach for bright DUV generation at 257 nm by making use of four-wave mixing in a gas-filled anti-resonant hollow core fiber. The use of a gas medium mitigates damage issues, while the efficient fiber throughput and non-resonant condition enhances the conversion efficiency. Finally, the flexibility of tuning the repetition rate, as well as the excellent beam quality, makes it possible to scale coherent light into the deep UV and vacuum regions."

Radiation shielding is indispensable for this situation since photons are always produced as secondary radiation of energetic charged particles and neutrons, and emitted from activated materials due to irradiation of primary particles. Shielding materials are used to protect people from ionizing radiation. In this work, we have studied the radiation shielding properties of the Al2O3-Sm2O3-PbO-P2O5 glass system using Phy-X/PSD and XCOM software for varying molar concentrations of PbO, P2O5, Al2O3, and Sm2O3. The gamma rays of energy ranging from 0.015 MeV to 15 MeV are considered for the study. The highest mass attenuation coefficient values are obtained in the low energy range in the order of 42.898 cm2g-1 to 73.385 cm2g-1 whereas the lowest mass attenuation values are obtained in the high energy range in order of 0.033 cm2g-1 to 0.044 cm2g-1. The half-value layer ranges from 0.002 cm to 4.756 cm within the energy range. The radiation shielding parameters; tenth value layer, effective electronic cross-section, effective charge state number, effective electron density, and fast neutron removal cross-sections are presented. The mean free path and fast neutron removal cross-sections of the sample are compared with other samarium-based glass and rock samples. Based on the shielding ability of glass samples they are arranged in increasing order as 48PbO-51.8P2O5-0.2Sm2O3 < 38PbO-60P2O5-1.8Al2O3-0.2Sm2O3 <48PbO- 50P2O5-1.8Al2O3-0.2Sm2O3 <58 PbO-40P2O5-1.8Al2O3 0.2Sm2O3.

We will explore the technology of particle accelerators at US national laboratories, and how physicists are working with modern laser and plasma technology to bring forth the next generation of more compact accelerators.

Niobium is the material of choice to build such cavities.  These cavities require a cryogenic cool-down to ~2 – 4 K for optimum performance minimizing RF losses on the inner cavity surface. However, temperature-independent residual losses in SRF cavities cannot be prevented entirely. One of the major sources of residual losses is trapped magnetic flux. The flux trapping mechanism depends on different factors, such as surface preparations and cool-down conditions. We have developed a diagnostic magnetic field scanning system (MFSS) using Hall probes and anisotropic magneto-resistance sensors to study the spatial distribution of trapped flux in 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities. The first result from this newly commissioned system revealed that the trapped flux on the cavity surface might redistribute with increasing RF power. The MFSS was also able to capture significant magnetic field enhancement at specific cavity locations after a quench."

In this experiment, the central part of apparatus consists of two coated PMMA cells which are sandwiched between grounded and high voltage electrodes. To achieve such a precision, the externally applied electric field has need to be stable at the 1% level over a time period of ~100 s. During this experiment, several sources of ambient ionizing radiation generate charged particles in the cryogenic liquid. These ionized charges are adsorbed on the cell walls. As a result, an opposing static electric field is generated, which will impact the stability of the electric field. Therefore, we at the University of Kentucky have devised a compact test setup to study the behavior of ions inside cryogenic liquids using a scaled-down version of the nEDM cell and the electrodes. In our setup, ion-electron pairs are generated by ionizing the nitrogen (helium) with a 137Cs source and the electro-optic Kerr effect is utilized to understand the cell charging effects within dummy measurement cell. We are in the process of developing a new method to measure the binding energy of the ions bonded on PMMA. The determination of the binding energy can potentially reduce the data taking time of the nEDM@SNS experiment if partial field reversal is sufficient. Results on the charging effect and the preliminary measurements of the binding energy will be presented."

The bandgap of the monolayer is wider than that of the bilayer/multilayer. This absorption process is described by Jablonski diagrams which may include two-step absorption with one-photon for each step, two-photon absorption to the real final state through a virtual intermediate state. In the one-photon excitation, the electric dipole transition from the initial to the final state is allowed due to different parities. This implies that the ground-state absorption cross-section is higher than the excited-state absorption cross-section which results in saturable (negative) absorption; SA). However, in the two-photon excitation case, the electric dipole transitions from the initial to the final state are allowed due to the same parities between them via an intermediate state.  It insinuates that the excited state absorption cross-section is higher than the ground state which consequences reverse saturable (positive) absorption; RSA). Therefore, the tunable bandgap corresponding to the number of layers switches RSA to SA or vice versa. The atomic layers with SA are utilized for laser Q-switch and mode-locker, while the atomic layers with RSA are utilized for optical power limiters.

The width of this streak shortens and becomes more intense near TC and is gradually suppressed by the application of H along the beam.

This study is enthralled by the effect of different parameters, like wavelengths, exposure time, and doses/irradiance of UV light on the microbial population. The effects on the DNA/RNA of the pathogen will be investigated before and after exposure to the UV light dose. Further, the QPCR/cell culture method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the effectiveness of UV-irradiation on the deactivation of the microbes will be investigated.

Hence it is very important to understand structural and dynamic properties of components of the systems in a suitable environment to understand their proper function. Membrane proteins are involved in several biological process that are required for the survival of living organisms: e. g., cellular transport, signaling, recognition and catalysis. These proteins are targets of more than 50% of all modern drugs. Mutations or misfolding of membrane proteins are linked to several human dysfunctions, disorders and diseases such as Long QT Syndrome, Alzheimer, etc. Despite the abundance and clear importance of membrane-associated molecules, very little information about these systems exists. X-ray crystallography and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are the most widely used biophysical techniques for obtaining detailed structural information on biological systems. Challenges in studying membrane proteins arise due to the hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins making overexpression, purification, and crystallization more difficult, and lacking of suitable solubilizing membrane mimetic. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) is a very powerful and rapidly growing technique that can resolve the limitations associated with these techniques and provide prominent solutions to obtain structural and dynamic information on peptides, proteins, macromolecules, and nucleic acids. Recent developments in improving structural biology techniques using some of the examples of biological problems associated with membrane proteins (potassium channel proteins) will be presented.

The AFM images showed the time-dependent interaction of ?-crystallin with the SLM. Force spectroscopy revealed the presence of breakthrough events in the force curves obtained in the membrane regions where no ?-crystallin was associated, which suggests that the membrane’s elasticity was maintained. The force curves in the ?-crystallin submerged region and the close vicinity of the ?-crystallin associated region in the membrane showed no breakthrough event within the defined peak force threshold, indicating loss of membrane elasticity.

Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared with and without decreasing the cholesterol (Chol) content from total lipids isolated from a single lens cortex of a two-year-old bovine using the rapid solvent exchange method and probe-tip sonication. Chol content in the cortical membranes was decreased by adding lipid (phospholipids and sphingolipid) mixtures resembling bovine lens lipid composition. The electron paramagnetic resonance spin-labeling method was used to measure the percentage of membrane surface occupied (MSO) by ?-crystallin, the binding affinity (Ka), and the physical properties (hydrophobicity, mobility parameter, and maximum splitting) of membranes. No significant binding of ?-crystallin with bovine lens lipid membranes derived from the single-lens cortex was observed. However, ?-crystallin binding with cortical membranes with reduced Chol content was observed. The smaller the Chol content in cortical membranes, the larger the MSO and Ka, and vice-versa. These results imply that the membrane Chol is a key component in preventing ?-crystallin binding with the bovine lens lipid membrane. Hydrophobicity near the surface of cortical membranes increased with the increased ?-crystallin binding, supporting the hypothesis that ?-crystallin binding with lens membranes forms a barrier to polar molecules. The profiles of mobility parameters decreased and maximum splitting showed no significant change with the increased ?-crystallin concentration, indicating that cortical membranes became less mobile with no significant change in order near the surface with the ?-crystallin binding. Our results show that the membrane Chol plays a crucial role in inhibiting ?-crystallin binding with the bovine lens lipid membrane, and such binding alters the physical properties of membranes playing a vital role in modulating the integrity of membranes. Moreover, this study demonstrates that it is feasible to investigate the binding of ?-crystallin with membranes derived from a single human lens. "

Although contemporary methods of combating COVID-19 such as vaccinations and social distancing had been effective methods, the evolution of new variants had continuously posed threat to the world. To overcome and tackle those challenges, more in-depth understanding of the SARS-C0V-2 virus is highly needed.
METHOD:
By using the quantum mechanical method through the density functional theory (DFT), we are able to efficiently monitor the reactions between virus and the noble metal nanoparticles as the potential curing treatments for the COVID-19. Therefore, theoretical explorations in this field will be significant for supplying key information for future curing methods. In this project, I have carried out quantum mechanical based theoretical calculations to investigate the interactions between noble metal nanoparticles and the S proteins. In this project, I have carried out quantum mechanical based theoretical calculations to investigate the interactions between noble metal nanoparticles and the S proteins. During the project, I will try several different noble metals including Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, and Pd, etc to interact with the S protein. For the proteins with extremely complicated structures and functional groups, I will focus on several key fragments of S protein. This project will reveal the interactions between the S protein fragments and noble metal nanoparticles regarding the binding strength, electronic structures, and stability of the fragments, etc. 
RESULT:
As the COVID-19 situation still developing in all countries, more efficient treatments should be developed alongside traditional vaccination developments. To disfunction the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the human body, we propose using the noble metal to disfunction the key S protein. In previous study on treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, metal NPs have been found to modify proteins and induce disfunction. Therefore, we also expect that such a strategy is also effective for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, owing to the high risks of the virus, the theoretical investigations are of great significance to perform preliminary studies of the potential interactions between Au and proteins. This strategy not only can lower the biomedical risks of COVID-19 but also save the large experiment time costs to find out the most possible candidates.

The investigation of molecular mechanism of Kaiso binding to N-CoR protein is helpful to understand the role of Kaiso in the transcription repression process. A detailed study on the molecular mechanism of the interaction of Kaiso with N-CoR complex is still lacking despite some prior studies on this system. In this work, we first modeled the Kaiso (BTB/POZ domain)-NCoR complex using molecular docking and then utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the structural features of Kaiso-NCoR interactions. Our MD simulation results show the complex between Kaiso and N-CoR is stable for 600 ns of simulation time as revealed by RMSD measurements. In addition, we identified the major interacting residues responsible for binding of the two proteins. Since the POZ domain of Kaiso is highly hydrophobic, the hydrophobic interaction plays an important role in the binding of Kaiso with N-CoR. We explored binding interactions such as formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonding that are responsible for the Kaiso-NCoR complex formation. "

Owing to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the TIs support conducting surface states that lie within the gapped bulk electronic spectrum of the TIs. These surface states are spin polarized and disperse linearly with Dirac-cone energy dispersion. Constraints of the time-reversal symmetry protect the surface states from backscattering and localization in the presence of nonmagnetic perturbations thereby making TIs promising for low-power energy-efficient quantum electronic applications. Recently, new types of topological materials inspired by magnetism have attracted intensive research interest. In this talk, I will discuss electronic structure evolution across the magnetic transition temperature for rare-earth monopnictide based materials and kagome magnets.  Our study indicates that magnetism plays an intricate role in the electronic structure of the topological material family."

research interest as they are examples of materials with tilted Dirac (or Weyl) cones indicating
the violation of Lorentz invariance. In contrast, the studies on anisotropic surface Dirac cones
in topological materials which contribute to ansiotropic carrier mobility have been limited. By
employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we reveal the
anisotropic surface Dirac dispersion in a tetradymite material Ti2Te2P on the (001) plane of the
Brillioun zone. We observe the quasi-elliptical Fermi pockets at the M -point of the Brillouin zone
forming the anisotropic surface Dirac cones. Our calculations of the Z2 indices confirm that the
system is topologically non-trivial with multiple topological phases in the same material. In addition, observed nodalline like features formed by bulk bands make this system topologically rich."

Ghosh,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Louisiana State University; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Louisiana State University",First-principles simulations of liquid iron-heavy element alloys at high pressure?? ,"Iron-rich metallic liquid is thought to contain many elements under Earth’s core conditions. While the incorporation of light elements has been studied extensively, our knowledge about liquid iron-heavy element mixtures is limited. Here we investigate the structural and dynamical behavior of four siderophile elements, namely Co, Ni, Mo, and W dissolved in liquid iron using first principles molecular dynamics over wide ranges of pressure (up to 380 GPa) and temperatures (4000 to 7000 K). The calculated pressure-volume-temperature results of these iron-rich alloys are accurately described by adding the appropriative terms to the equation of state of pure iron liquid to account for the effects of temperature and impurity. The simulation results show that the bulk modulus remains almost unaffected by the added impurities while Mo and W increase the melt density much more than Co and Ni mainly due to their heavier mass. To explain the density and seismic velocity profiles of the outer core, light elements like H and C must be added to liquid iron alloys in large amounts. The calculated mean iron coordination number of each of four heavy elements considered is somewhat larger than the mean Fe-Fe coordination number. This suggests that their incorporation is of substitutional nature unlike interstitial mechanism for H and C. The lack of clustering activity, and intra-species interactions of these heavy impurity atoms suggest they are soluble in liquid iron. The diffusion rates of these impurities are found to be comparable to that of host atoms, but they are much lower than those of light elements."

In particular, kagome materials, revealing large responses to external stimuli such as pressure or magnetic field, are subject to special investigation. Here, we study the kagome-net HoMn6Sn6 magnet that undergoes paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition (below 376 K) and reveals spin-reorientation transition below 200 K. In this compound, we observe the topological Hall effect and substantial contribution of anomalous Hall effect above 100 K. We unveil the pressure effects on magnetic ordering at a low magnetic field from the pressure tunable magnetization measurement. By utilizing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Dirac-like dispersion at the high-symmetry point K is revealed in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which is well supported by the first-principles calculations, suggesting a possible Chern-gapped Dirac cone in this compound.

properties in their magnetic and electronic structures. YMn6Sn6 is one such compound in which a series of competing magnetic phases is stabilized by applied magnetic field, and both an enigmatic topological Hall effect and a Dirac crossing close to the Fermi energy have been realized. This material also shows a magnetization induced Lifshitz transition and evidence of an efficient charge-spin coupling in one of the magnetic phases, namely the fan-like phase. Tuning the magnetism, and thus the interplay with the electronic states, opens new avenues into precise control of these novel properties. Here, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of the magnetic phases in YMn6Sn6-xGex via magnetization and magnetotransport measurements. The high degree of sensitivity to small doping concentrations provides great potential for engineering the magnetic phases and associated electronic properties in this family of rare-earth kagome magnets."

Magnetic WSMs that arise from broken time-reversal symmetry provide an exceptional platform to understand the interplay between magnetic order and Weyl physics, but few WSMs have been realized. Here, we identify CeAlSi as a new non-centrosymmetric magnetic WSM via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles density-functional theory-based calculations. Our surface-sensitive vacuum ultraviolet ARPES data confirms the presence of surface Fermi arcs as the smoking gun evidence for the existence of the Weyl semimetallic state in CeAlSi. We also observe bulk Weyl cones in CeAlSi using bulk-sensitive soft-X-ray ARPES measurements. In addition, Ce 4f flat bands are found near the Fermi level, indicating that CeAlSi is a unique platform for investigating exotic quantum phenomena resulting from the interaction of topology, magnetism, and electronic correlations."

The existence of natively fluctuating magnetic ground states manipulate are of interest due to their potential applications in data storage and quantum computing devices, and a key means of understanding these quantum spin liquid states is to perturb the state and induce long-range magnetic order.   Here we present the evolution of long-range order magnetic order in the quantum spin liquid candidate NaYbSe2 by the application of both an external magnetic field and through the introduction of non-magnetic Lu impurities. The substitution of Lu3+-ions in the triangular lattice network should dilute the competing interactions, between Yb3+-ions, responsible for the QSL state and induce magnetic order at finite temperature.  The nature of nearby field-driven magnetic order and its ability to be stabilized via impurity substitution will be discussed."

The data obtained through QMC in imaginary time or frequency is not straightforward for obtaining physical observables. 
The real frequency spectral function, A(?) from the Green’s function, G(?i??_? ) is an ill-posed problem due to the large conditional number of the kernel matrix. The small noise in G(?i??_? ) can lead to large fluctuations in A(?) and hence to solve this optimization problem efficiently, we use the Maximum Entropy Model (MEM) based on Bayesian statistical rule.
In this study, the Maximum Entropy Model is used to investigate the Mott-Hubbard type metal–insulator transition (MIT) along with the optically induced transport behaviour of the system.
