is lost when it crosses their event horizons. This idea is challenged by the information paradox, which raises questions about the preservation 
of information in light of quantum mechanics.

Objective: This manuscript aims to propose a new hypothesis that redefines the nature of black holes by suggesting they function as 
dimensional portals, preserving information instead of destroying it.

Methods: A mathematical model is introduced, featuring a teleportation function, T(D), that describes how information transforms when 
moving from our three-dimensional space into a higher-dimensional framework.

Results: The proposed hypothesis aligns with the principles of quantum mechanics, suggesting that information is retained in a different 
dimension and may enhance our understanding of black hole thermodynamics, including concepts like Hawking radiation and entropy.

Conclusion: The idea of black holes as dimensional portals offers a fresh perspective on the information paradox and presents new avenues 
for future research in both theoretical and observational physics.

Among them, a class of ULF waves with a period of approximately 3 seconds has garnered growing interest due to their distinguished characteristics and largely unexplored generation mechanisms. First detected in ISEE magnetometer data, these waves are typically right-hand polarized, nearly circular in the spacecraft frame, and occur in high plasma beta environments, where thermal pressure dominates over magnetic pressure. These waves can exist in different regions of the foreshock where other waves can also exist. When 3-second waves appear in regions with a stable magnetic field, they are typically accompanied by ion beams reflected from the Earthâ€™s bow shock, whereas in areas with a more irregular magnetic background, the associated ion distributions tend to be more isotropic. These waves are also sometimes observed to be superimposed on lower frequency waves with a wave period of ~30-second.
Our study conducts a comprehensive statistical analysis of ULF waves with a time period around 3 seconds (frequency ~ 2-4 HZ) using 10 years of MMS field and particle data. We identified wave events using spectral wavelet analysis technique and minimum variance analysis on the magnetic field measurements to determine the wave frequency and polarization. Multi-spacecraft timing methods are employed to derive the wave propagation directions and its phase velocity in the plasma rest frame. We also analyzed the high resolution ion velocity distribution functions  to characterize the suprathermal (i.e. particles with energies higher than the energies of solar wind particles) ion population during these 3-s wave events, which are then used as inputs for the wave dispersion solver to identify the plasma instability responsible for generating these plasma waves.

This study investigates seismo-ionospheric coupling phenomena associated with two moderate earthquakes (Mw 6.4) that occurred in Indonesia in 2024. The first event took place on March 22 near Paciran (5.875Â°S, 112.365Â°E) at a depth of 9.5 km, and the second on April 9 near Tobelo (2.698Â°N, 127.062Â°E) at a depth of 22.0 km. Ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) variations were analyzed using GNSS data from permanent ground stations BNOA and BTNG, provided by UNAVCO. A running-quartile method was applied to determine the upper and lower bounds of TEC variations. For the Paciran earthquake, anomalous TEC signals were detected 4â€“20 days prior to the event. Similarly, for the Tobelo earthquake, anomalies were observed 13â€“14 days before the event. To validate these findings, Global Ionospheric Map (GIM) data from the International GNSS Service (IGS) were examined, which revealed enhanced TEC  over the respective epicentral regions on the identified anomalous days. The study discusses possible physical mechanisms responsible for these pre-seismic ionospheric perturbations.

The beauty of physics lies in the freedom that it offers researchers to explore these questions with creativity. One emerging field is the quantum theory of consciousness, which takes analytical, theoretical, mathematical, and philosophical approaches to understand the universe from a unique perspective. Quantum field theory, for instance, describes how different fields give rise to different particlesâ€”such as the Higgs boson arising from the Higgs fieldâ€”providing insight into the origin of mass from the field itself. The study of the quantum theory of consciousness may offer a new lens through which to comprehend the nature of reality itself. This study is especially vital, as it not only seeks to explain the nature of reality but also considers the observer who perceives it. Since space-time forms the framework within which nearly all physical events occur, incorporating consciousness into this framework could deepen our understanding of existence. This kind of new study holds an enormous potentiality to unlock new perspectives on black holes, dark matter, and more.

It is studied through the laser-induced spatial self-phase modulation (SSPM) of an optical field, revealing the nonlinear refraction coefficients. SSPM of the optical field in liquid suspensions of tungsten and molybdenum disulfide atomic layers produced multiple concentric diffraction rings in the far field due to the laser-induced intensity-dependent refractive index in the materials.

However, with age and cataract formation, the Î±-crystallin subunits (Î±A- and Î±B-crystallin) accumulate various mutations and post-translational modifications that impair Î±-crystallin function and promote the formation of membrane-bound high molecular weight crystallin complexes that can scatter light entering the eye and impair vision.

However, Q147E-Î±Ac membrane binding was inhibited at 60 mol% Chol. WT- and Q147E-Î±Ac membrane binding decreased membrane mobility while increasing order and hydrophobicity near the headgroup. However, Chol diminished this increase in membrane hydrophobicity and lowered membrane hydrophobicity, indicating WT- and Q147E-Î±Ac membrane binding is likely done through hydrophobic interactions, and Chol impairs these interactions. Our results suggest that the high phosphatidylcholine content of young lenses might prevent WT-Î±Ac binding.

A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distictive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of smectic -C phase to the case of 90Â° director tilt ,a â€œfirst-order approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependancies of the splay, twist and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a profound and unparalleled effect on modern society, disrupting public health systems, economies, education, and cultural life. A single drug or vaccine may not be sufficient to counter emerging variants of the virus. Additionally, the complexity and side effects linked to earlier vaccines have contributed to ongoing hesitancy among certain groups. Mpro is a vital coronavirus enzyme responsible for viral replication and transcription, making it a prime target for SARS-CoV-2 drug development. In this study, the crystal structure of Mpro (PDB id: 6LU7) was utilized, and ligands from the ZINC database, identified as natural products, were screened for drugability using Lipinski rule of 5.  Subsequent screenings involved targeting h-MAT1A and CYP3a4 proteins. Further screening was carried out as target protein docking and  phase-1 drug clearances. The best ligands according to the docking score were  selected. The selected  ligands were further examined using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations for validation as potential drug candidates. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the selected ligands exhibit considerable stability and establish numerous hydrogen bonds with the protein. Both DFT analysis and MD simulations indicate that the proposed ligands are promising as Mpro inhibitors and warrant further evaluation, including clinical trials.

Reliable and minimally invasive tools for monitoring disease progression remain a clinical challenge. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy has emerged as a promising technique for detecting molecular-level alterations in biological samples due to its rapid and label-free nature. This study investigated the potential of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to identify serum-based spectral biomarkers (SBMs) associated with the progression of colitis in a mouse model. Colitis was induced in mice by administering 3% Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for seven consecutive days, and blood serum samples were collected on Day 0 (control), Day 3 (mild colitis), and Day 7 (severe colitis). Through curve-fitting analysis of the absorbance spectra, changes within sample constituents reflected in spectral data were detected as early as Day 3, becoming more pronounced by Day 7. Notably, a progressive and statistically significant (SS) (p < 0.05) decrease was observed in the Î±-helix/Î²-sheet integral ratio within the Amide I region, indicating protein conformational changes. Concurrently, the Î²-sheet/tyrosine integral ratio in the Amide II region exhibited an SS increase, particularly from Day 3 to Day 7. In addition to protein alterations, SS increase in the integral areas of the ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching in lipids and the whole carbohydrate region were observed at the severe stage. In total, fourteen SBMs showed SS variation from Day 0 to Day 7. These findings highlight the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy technique as a reliable and minimally invasive method for monitoring the progression of colitis.

In spite of the small size of the pores—which would be expected to cause very low intrinsic permeability—field reports document unusually high flow rates. Liquid flow in nanopores is different from the flow in large pores. To compensate for this difference, the traditional liquid flow model needs a correction parameter called liquid slip length. We measured slip length of brine and pore walls in shale by using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The measured force spectroscopy data then used in Navier-Stokes equation with slip boundary conditions to determine liquid slip length of different liquid types and pore materials, e.g., organic pores and inorganic mineral types. Our measurements suggest a slip length of 250 nm in organic pores. Such a large slip length relative to the nanopore size (10s-100s nm), suggests significant effects on liquid flow in shale nanoporous structures.

Neutron diffraction is particularly essential in this study, as X-ray diffraction alone cannot precisely determine the atomic positions due to the similar X-ray scattering cross-sections of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) atoms. In contrast, neutron diffraction provides significantly different scattering cross-sections for O and N, enabling accurate crystal structure identification of SiAlON ceramics. It is found that the interstitial doping of Er stabilizes the α-SiAlON structure via chemical bonds with O-atoms with an N:O ratio of 5:2 in the seven-fold coordination sites of the Er3+ ion. Temperature-dependent upconversion emissions are then studied under 980 and 793 nm excitations over a temperature range of 298–1373 K, and the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique has been employed to investigate the temperature sensing behavior. Temperature-dependent Raman behavior is also investigated. We demonstrate that using Er-α-SiAlON as a sensing material, the limit of temperature measurement via the FIR technique can be pushed well beyond 1200 K.",Invited,,,,,,2025-07-18,23:30,2025-07-19,0:00

The different layers of cobalt oxide films were prepared on an FTO-coated glass substrate, and the films formed were blackish-white. The prepared films were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra showed the two stretching bands Co(III)-O and Co(II)-O, which confirms the material composition of Co3O4. The optical measurements demonstrated that increasing the layers of cobalt oxide films, the band gap energy decreases. The thickest layer (Layer 9) showed the minimum band gap of about 2.21 eV. The impedance measurement was carried out from the high to low-frequency range, where the obtained impedance spectrum revealed enhanced conductivity and reduced grain boundary resistance with increasing film thickness, which may be due to increased mobility of charge carriers and reduced grain size. These results showed the tunable optical properties and enhanced charge transfer, highlighting the potential application for optoelectronic devices and supercapacitor applications.

Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasetsâ€”an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs.
The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2\% to 6.67\% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE)â€”and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction.

Our computational modeling and experimental observations provide an invaluable tool to actually understand the detailed mechanism behind the observed work function reduction via the ever-existent Pauli repulsion.

While a phenomenological two-level coupling model can fit the observed linear Stark shift and oscillator strength enhancement, it overestimates interlayer coupling strengths and lacks physical insight. Our microscopic hole-tunneling model demonstrates that electric fields redistribute hole wavefunctions across layers, enabling symmetry-allowed interlayer tunneling and exciton hybridization. This mechanism naturally explains both the 1s and 2s Rydberg states while predicting accurate coupling strengths.

In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the SERS activity of Nbâ‚‚CTâ‚“ nanosheets using methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV) as probe molecules under 532 nm and 488 nm laser excitations. The Raman enhancement factors (EFs) for MB and CV with 532 nm excitation were found to be 2.12 Ã— 10â¶ and 2.65 Ã— 10â´, respectively. The significantly higher enhancement observed for MB, two orders of magnitude greater than that for CV, is attributed to a light-induced resonance charge transfer process between MB and Nbâ‚‚CTâ‚“. Our findings suggest that the Raman enhancement of the probe molecules is determined by the interplay between the excitation energy and the electronic properties of both the SERS substrate and the probe molecules. SERS measurements performed under 488 nm excitation further support the proposed charge transfer mechanism. Additionally, the SERS performance of Nbâ‚‚CTâ‚“ was benchmarked against other MXenes and conventional SERS substrates. While Nbâ‚‚CTâ‚“ may not achieve single-molecule detection sensitivity, it demonstrates sufficient enhancement to detect various chemical and environmental analytes with practical sensitivity.

A noninvasive technique is necessary to detect hypoxia and assess its existence, extent, and spatial distribution within a tumor. In order to develop a noninvasive tool for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, we propose a muon method and detected the molecular oxygen in water and dilute protein solutions (Hb, TBS, albumin, serum)[3][4]. To interpret the muon experiment, theoretical study is necessary to understand the stopping sites and charge states of injected muon into biomolecules. In our earlier work, based on minimum potential energy, we found the stopping site of the muonium in the heme group of DeoxyHb, OxyHb, and CoHb around the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring of histidine [5]. 
Muon is a like a light proton with mass around 1/9 of that of a proton. Since the muon's gyromagnetic ratio is around three times greater than that of the proton, it is highly sensitive to magnetic field in materials. Muonium(Mu) on the other hand, is bound state of a positive muon and an electron with similar chemical properties of H atom [6]. Relaxation rate of Mu due to spin exchange interaction with O2 provides the information about the existence of O2 in the solutions [7]. To understand the muon data in hemoglobin, we perform first-principles study in the protophyrin and porphyrin to estimate the stopping site and charge states of the muon. The estimated hyperfine coupling terms will be helpful to support the muon experiment in the Hb derivatives. In the program, the stopping sites and hyperfine coupling interaction of Mu in the protoporphyrin and porphyrin will be presented.

Effective shielding helps protect human health, equipment, and the environment in medical, industrial, and research settings. This study evaluates the shielding properties of waste materials plastic bottles, human hair, disposable medical gloves, and cardboard against three radioactive sources: Thallium (204Tl), Cesium (137Cs), and Strontium (90Sr), with present activities 0.05 ÂµCi, 1.125 ÂµCi, and 0.130 ÂµCi, respectively. Samples of each material were prepared in solid form with dimensions 3 Ã— 4 Ã— 0.2 cm. Using a Geiger-MÃ¼ller (GM) counter (Model No: TE Np 1, 220-230V, 50 Hz) at Patan Multiple Campus, radiation counts/minute were measured with the sample placed 6 cm from the source and 4 cm from the detector window, operated at 400 V. Without shielding, the counts/minutes recorded were 38 Â± 3 counts/minute with 204Tl sources , 72Â± 4 counts/minute with 137Cs sources, and 182Â± 3 counts/minute with 90Sr sources. When shielded, the counts/minute observed for the 204Tl source were with plastic bottle is 32Â± 3  counts/minute, human hair is 6Â± 3 counts/minute, gloves is 6Â± 3 counts/minute, and cardboard is 30Â± 3  counts/minute; for the 137Cs source with plastic bottle is 58 counts/minute, human hair is 12Â± 3 counts/minute, gloves is 12Â± 3 counts/minute, and cardboard is 52Â± 3 counts/minute; and for the 90Sr source with plastic bottle is 180Â± 4  counts/minute, human hair is 20Â± 4  counts/minute, gloves is 26Â± 4  counts/minute, and cardboard is 132Â± 4 counts/minute.

Abstract
We have investigated dust-ion acoustic solitary and shock waves in a magnetized dusty plasma and explored the features of solitary and shock waves in Saturnâ€™s E-ringâ€™s dusty plasma, in account of anisotropic ion pressure and dust charge fluctuations. The dust charge equation has been solved via Newtonâ€™s Raphson method. The modified damped KdV and Burgerâ€™s equations have been extended and analytically solved. In the case of space dusty plasma, we have taken the physical parameters relevant to Saturnâ€™s E-ring and both compressive and rarefactive solitary and shock waves are evolved. The features of monotonic shock waves are significantly affected by the nonextensive parameter q, magnitude of magnetic field, obliqueness of wave propagation, anisotropic ion pressure, and size of dust grain as well. Furthermore, the dust charge fluctuation rate plays a crucial role in the study of shock wave evolution on Saturnâ€™s E-ring dusty plasma.

Kaligandaki River, one of major Rivers of Nepal, originates from Damodarkund close to Lomanthang, where deposit of Uranium have been confirmed by Department of Mines and Geology, Nepal. The famous fossilized stone Shaligram is also found only in this region. To carry out the study, we used the portable gamma-ray spectrometer PGIS-2, which is equipped with a NaI(Tl) detector. We determined radiological hazard parameters associated with the radionuclides, including radium equivalent activity, absorbed gamma dose rates in the air, annual effective dose rate, external hazard index, and internal hazard index. The results showed that 238U activity ranged from 55.17 Bq kgâˆ’1 to 125.63 Bq kgâˆ’1 with mean value 83.31 Â± 19.49 Bq kgâˆ’1, 232Th activity ranged from 2.28 Bq kgâˆ’1 to 144.22 Bq  kgâˆ’1 with mean value 61.55  Â± 31.29 Bq kgâˆ’1 and 40K activity ranged from 92.48 Bq kgâˆ’1 to 1158.06 Bq kgâˆ’1 with mean value 631.44 Â± 269.95 Bq kgâˆ’1. Mean values of the activities of all three radionuclides were found to be above the world average value. Radiological parameters like Raeq, ADR, Hex and Hin were found to be 219.95 Â± 72.76 Bq kgâˆ’1, 102.18 Â± 33.53 nGy hr-1  0.59 and 0.82 respectively.

For example, in biology, O2 binding hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin) contains Fe in ferrous states in its heme-group however the methemoglobin that cannot bind the O2 contains the ferric states of the Fe. From magnetic point of view, oxyhemoglobin shows diamagnetic nature however the methemoglobin shows the strong paramagnetic behavior. Since muon acts as a sensitive local probe, it can detect local electronic and dynamic states of materials. To understand the muon experimental data, computational technique, particularly density functional theory (DFT), is essential for revealing muon sites in the materials. Here we choose metal-halides with differing oxidation states (Fe2+ in FeCl2, Fe3+ in FeCl3, and Zn2+ in ZnCl2) to understand the behavior of muon in samples with different oxidation states. The FeClâ‚‚ and FeClâ‚ƒ exhibit magnetic ordering [1], while the ZnClâ‚‚ exhibits nonmagnetic [1]; consequently, the muonâ€™s local stopping site, spin polarization, and electronic interactions vary among these compounds [2, 3]. We focus to identify and compare the muon sites and estimate its polarization in different oxidation states, and then investigate muonâ€“metal interactions. In the program, the DFT result of muon behavior in FeCl2 and ZnCl2 will be presented.

To detect hypoxia, a non-invasive muon method has been proposed [3,4], which is expected to compensate for the current unavailability of such a method [5]. The development of the proposed muon method requires an organized muon spin rotation and relaxation (ÂµSR) study of biomacromolecules. Oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb), a hemoglobin (Hb) derivative, transports oxygen (O2) from lungs to tissues and exhibits diamagnetism. Muon is similar to a proton with a lighter mass (mÂµ = 1/9 mp) and greater magnetic moment (ÂµÂµ = 3.2 Âµp). It is an exotic magnetic probe sensitive to the magnetic field in the material. Muonium (Mu), a bound state of a muon and an electron (Âµ+e-), is like a light hydrogen isotope and directly interacts with O2. In this study, we performed ZF- and weak TF-ÂµSR measurements in two concentrations (114.5 g/L and 5 g/L) of aqueous OxyHb solutions (purified from human blood) at temperatures ranging from 300 K to 140 K.
Isotropic Mu in liquid and axially symmetric anisotropic Mu in frozen phase are observed via concentration-dependent studies. In the liquid phase, in addition to the paramagnetic Mu, a diamagnetic muon species (H2O-Mu+-H2O) is observed, while in the frozen phase, two diamagnetic muon species (H2O-Mu+-H2O and MuOH) are observed, like in ice [6] and buffer [7]. The observed values of the Mu hyperfine transitions are in close approximation to the theoretically predicted values.

It has proven incapable of fulfilling the core mission of higher education: ""to ensure that every student is skilled in their chosen field, guaranteed a job aligned with their skills, or successfully transitioned to advanced studies"". Based on this authorâ€™s direct experience teaching and mentoring undergraduate physics students, it is evident that students and faculty have minimal influence over institutional priorities or success metrics. Decisions are predominantly made by upper-level administrators, with policies handed down with little genuine input from those directly involved in teaching and learning. This has created a rigid structure resistant even to the idea that such student-centered goals are achievable.
Despite this systemic resistance, the author has witnessed firsthand the potential and capability of studentsâ€”who, when supported properly, can thrive both academically and professionally. The problem is not a lack of talent, but a misalignment of priorities: students are burdened by financial independence from a young age, forced to balance full-time work with full-time study, and left without adequate institutional support. 
This presentation advocates for ""a bottom-up educational model"" in which students are the central focus, faculty are empowered architects of curriculum and implementation, and administration functions as support infrastructure rather than directive authority. The author proposes that colleges must guarantee that every student receives training in their field of passion and is supported to either employment or advanced education. 
All aspects of the failed ""top-down model"" and the promising ""bottom-up"" alternative will be discussed in detail. The author argues that a complete paradigm shift is not only necessary but entirely achievableâ€”and that such a transformation is vital for unlocking the true educational potential of the nation.

This trend is also observed in Nepal.
Studies on diversity, equity, and inclusion in physics learning environments reveal significant gender disparities in introductory physics and mathematics courses. Such disparities adversely affect young women's decisions to pursue degrees in physics.
To address this gap, physics education should incorporate instructional practices proven effective in other STEM fields. These include practices like active learning and inclusive strategies, collaborative learning, peer instruction, and formative assessments. 
These methods support historically marginalized students and contribute positively to the learning experience in physics education. This presentation will provide a detailed analysis of these strategies and their practical applications for an inclusive future in physics.
